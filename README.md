# JobSkillsDashboard

This is an attempt to deploy an end-to-end dashboarding solution to display job skills data. The data is extracted from Burning Glass reports to populate a database. 
We then build up an backend api to serve data to a React frontend which is turn is served from a nginx server. 

We use docker-compose to build up the entire system in one shot.
